# Epic Plan

**Purpose:** Bridge shaping to scoping — take concept, concept-design, and research files and produce a scoped epic with backlog items.
**Input:** Shaping-tier files (via `$ARGUMENTS` or interactive discovery)
**Output:** `.project/backlog/epic_{name}.md` + updated `BACKLOG.md`

## Before You Start

Read these fully:
- `.project/EPIC_GUIDE.md` — decomposition methodology, sizing rules, item template, quality checks. Follow it. Do not restate it here.
- `.project/epic_template.md` — the output structure. Copy it; do not improvise a format.
- `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md` — existing epics, so you don't duplicate or collide.

## Finding Input Files

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a file path or concept name, use it. If ambiguous or missing, scan `.project/concepts/` and `.project/research/` and ask the user which files are the source material for this epic.

Read every identified source file fully before proceeding.

## Stage 1: Scope

1. Copy `.project/epic_template.md` to `.project/backlog/epic_{name}.md`. Derive the epic name from the primary concept; you'll confirm it with the user below.
2. Fill in these sections from the source material:
   - **Epic ID, Status** (Draft), **Priority**, **Created**, **Estimated Effort** (rough)
   - **Executive Summary** — what this epic delivers and why, in 2-3 sentences
   - **Source Documents** — list every shaping-tier file you read, with type annotations (concept, concept-design, research)
   - **Why This Epic** — current state vs. future state
   - **Success Criteria** — measurable outcomes as checkboxes
3. **Present to the user.** Show the epic name, executive summary, source documents, and success criteria. Ask for confirmation.
4. **Wait for approval.** Adjust as directed. Do not proceed to decomposition until the user approves the scope.

## Stage 2: Decompose

1. Using the EPIC_GUIDE methodology, identify natural backlog item boundaries in the scoped work.
2. **Present the proposed breakdown in-console** — a table or structured list showing each item's name, type, estimated effort, and one-line purpose:

   ```
   | # | Item | Type | Effort | Purpose |
   |---|------|------|--------|---------|
   | 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
   ```

   Include a brief note on the critical path and which items can run in parallel.
3. **Wait for approval.** Adjust item boundaries, ordering, or scope as directed. Do not proceed to writing items until the user approves the decomposition.

## Stage 3: Write Items

1. Think through carefully:
   - **Dependencies** between items — what must complete before what?
   - **Required Reading** per item — which source documents carry intent relevant to each specific item? Different items may reference different subsets. Not every item needs Required Reading.
   - **Epic Strategy** — value delivery path, critical path, decomposition rationale.
   - **De-risking** — does any item rest on an unverified bet about how something behaves? If so, consider surfacing a `/_my_spike` (confirm a known assumption with throwaway code) or `/_my_learning_test` (map an unfamiliar surface with kept tests) as an early item or first phase, so the bet is tested before dependents build on it.
2. Write the full backlog items into the epic file, following the item template in `EPIC_GUIDE.md`. Fill in Epic Strategy, the dependency graph, risks, and timeline sections.
3. Add an entry to `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md` following the existing format (priority, status, estimate, brief description, items list with checkboxes).
4. Present the completed epic to the user.
