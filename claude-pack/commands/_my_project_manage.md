# Project Management Command

**Purpose**: Comprehensive project management with multiple modes of operation
**Usage**: `/_my_project_manage [mode] [arguments]`

---

## Modes

| Mode | Usage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `status` | `/_my_project_manage` or `/_my_project_manage status` | Full status report with gap analysis (default) |
| `decompose` | `/_my_project_manage decompose <epic-name>` | Break down an epic into backlog items |
| `close` | `/_my_project_manage close [item-name]` | Close out completed item(s) |
| `backlog` | `/_my_project_manage backlog` | Interactive backlog management |

---

## Mode: `status` (Default)

**Usage**: `/_my_project_manage` or `/_my_project_manage status`

Generate a comprehensive project status report with assessment and recommendations.

### Process

#### Stage 1: Gather Context

Read project management files in this order:

1. **Current State**:
   - `.project/CURRENT_WORK.md` - What's active now
   - `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md` - Epic priorities

2. **Active Work** (if any):
   - `.project/active/*/_my_plan.md` - Current implementation plans
   - `.project/active/*/_my_spec.md` - What's being built

3. **History**:
   - `.project/completed/CHANGELOG.md` - What's been done
   - Recent reports in `.project/reports/`

4. **Backlog Details**:
   - `.project/backlog/epic_*.md` - Upcoming epic definitions

#### Stage 2: Analyze

**Current State**:
- Which epics/items are active, completed, or planned?
- What was recently completed?
- What's blocked or at risk?

**Project Health**:
- Are docs up to date?
- Is CURRENT_WORK.md accurate?
- Are there orphaned or stale files?
- Is backlog well-prioritized?

**Gaps**:
- Inconsistencies between files
- Missing documentation
- Incomplete success criteria
- Stale dates or status

#### Stage 3: Generate Report

Save to `.project/reports/{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM}-status-report.md`:

```markdown
# Project Status Report

**Date**: [Date]
**Generated by**: /_my_project_manage status

---

## Current Status

**Active Epic**: [Name or "None"]
**Active Item**: [Name or "None"]
**Overall Progress**: [Summary]

### Recent Completions

---

## How Can I Help?

**A) Start Next Item**: Begin work on recommended next item
**B) Decompose Epic**: Break down an epic → `/_my_project_manage decompose <epic>`
**C) Close Item**: Complete current item → `/_my_project_manage close <item>`
**D) Backlog Work**: Manage backlog → `/_my_project_manage backlog`
**E) Custom Request**: Tell me what you need

---

What would you like to do?
```

---

## Mode: `decompose`

**Usage**: `/_my_project_manage decompose <epic-name>`

Break down an epic into well-scoped backlog items following the EPIC_GUIDE methodology.

### Process

#### Stage 1: Load Epic and Methodology

1. **Read the epic definition**:
   - `.project/backlog/epic_<name>.md` or search for matching epic
   - If not found, list available epics and ask which one

2. **Read decomposition guide**:
   - `.project/EPIC_GUIDE.md` - Decomposition methodology

#### Stage 2: Analyze Epic Scope

Review and understand:
- **Value**: What does this epic deliver?
- **Components**: What are the major pieces of work?
- **Dependencies**: What must happen in what order?
- **Total effort**: Rough estimate of overall size

#### Stage 3: Identify Natural Boundaries

Look for separations by:
- **Task type**: Research, design, implementation, testing
- **Deliverables**: Distinct outputs
- **Dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel work
- **Effort**: 0.5-2 days per item (including planning)

#### Stage 4: Define Backlog Items

For each potential item, verify:

**Scope Check**:
- [ ] Single cohesive task type?
- [ ] Clear, measurable success criteria?
- [ ] 0.5-2 days including planning?
- [ ] Non-trivial (benefits from spec → design → plan)?

**Independence Check**:
- [ ] Can be spec'd and designed independently?
- [ ] Clear inputs (dependencies)?
- [ ] Clear outputs (deliverables)?

#### Stage 5: PAUSE FOR FEEDBACK ⚠️

**STOP. Do NOT proceed to write the epic document yet.**

Present your analysis to the user and gather feedback:

```markdown
# Epic Decomposition Analysis: [Epic Name]

## My Understanding

[Summarize what this epic is trying to accomplish in 2-3 sentences]

## Proposed Items

| # | Item | Type | Effort | Purpose |
|---|------|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Type] | X days | [One sentence] |
| 2 | [Name] | [Type] | X days | [One sentence] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total Estimated Effort**: X days

## Questions for You

Before I write this up, I want to make sure I understand correctly:

1. **Priority/Focus**: Are there specific items you want to prioritize or skip?
2. **Risks/Challenges**: What do you see as the biggest risks or challenges?
3. **Scope Concerns**: Should any items be combined or split differently?
4. **Missing Items**: Is there anything I'm missing or overlooking?
5. **Context I Need**: Is there background context that would change this breakdown?

## My Assumptions

- [Assumption 1 I'm making]
- [Assumption 2 I'm making]
- [Any uncertainty I have]

---

**Please share your thoughts before I proceed to write the epic document.**
```

**Wait for user response** before proceeding to Stage 6.

Incorporate user feedback:
- Adjust items based on their priorities
- Address risks they identify
- Modify scope as directed
- Add context they provide

#### Stage 6: Edit Epic Document

Add backlog items to the epic document using this format:

```markdown
## Backlog Items

### Item 1: [Clear Name] [Effort: X days]

**Type**: [Research | Design | Implementation | Testing]
**Objective**: [One sentence]

**Scope**:
1. [Major component 1]
2. [Major component 2]

**Out of Scope**:
- [What's NOT included]

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]

**Dependencies**: [None | Item N must complete first]
**Deliverables**: spec.md, design.md, plan.md, [other outputs]

---

### Item 2: [Name] [Effort: X days]
...
```

#### Stage 7: Update Tracking

- Update epic status in `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md`
- Report the decomposition summary to user

### Output

```markdown
# Epic Decomposition: [Epic Name]

## Summary
[Brief description of what the epic delivers]

## Items Identified

| # | Item | Type | Effort | Dependencies |
|---|------|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Type] | X days | None |
| 2 | [Name] | [Type] | X days | Item 1 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total Effort**: X days (estimated)

## Updated Files
- `.project/backlog/epic_<name>.md` - Added backlog items
- `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md` - Updated epic status

## Next Steps
Ready to start Item 1? Use `/_my_spec` in the item's active folder to begin.
```

---

## Mode: `close`

**Usage**: `/_my_project_manage close [item-name]`

Close out completed work item(s) with proper archival and tracking updates.

### If no item specified: Review all active items

When called without an argument (`/_my_project_manage close`), review ALL items under `.project/active/`:

#### Step 1: Scan active items

For each folder in `.project/active/`:
- Read `spec.md` to understand what it is
- Read `plan.md` to check completion status
- Look for completion indicators (all phases done, deliverables exist)

#### Step 2: Present status table

```markdown
# Active Items Review

| Item | Started | Status | Completeness | Recommendation |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| [item-1] | [date] | ✅ Complete | All phases done | Close |
| [item-2] | [date] | 🔄 In Progress | Phase 2 of 3 | Keep open |
| [item-3] | [date] | ✅ Complete | Deliverables exist | Close |
| [item-4] | [date] | ⚠️ Stale | No activity 7+ days | Review |

## Items Ready to Close

Based on my review, these items appear complete:
- `item-1` - [Brief summary of what was accomplished]
- `item-3` - [Brief summary of what was accomplished]

## Confirm Closure

Which items should I close?

**A) Close all completed** (item-1, item-3)
**B) Close specific items** - Tell me which ones
**C) Review an item first** - I'll show details before deciding
**D) Cancel** - Don't close anything

---

What would you like to do?
```

#### Step 3: Wait for user confirmation

**Do NOT close items without explicit user confirmation.**

### If item specified: Close that item

When called with an argument (`/_my_project_manage close <item-name>`):

#### Process

1. **Verify completion**:
   - Check `.project/active/<item-name>/` exists
   - Review deliverables and success criteria
   - Present summary and ask for confirmation:

   ```markdown
   # Close Item: [Item Name]

   ## Summary
   [What this item accomplished]

   ## Deliverables
   - [x] spec.md - [status]
   - [x] design.md - [status]
   - [x] plan.md - [status]
   - [Other deliverables]

   ## Confirm
   Ready to archive this item to `.project/completed/`?
   ```

2. **Archive item** (after confirmation):
   ```bash
   mv .project/active/<item-name> .project/completed/$(date +%Y%m%d)_<item-name>
   ```

3. **Update tracking documents**:
   - `.project/CURRENT_WORK.md`:
     - Remove from active work
     - Add to "Recently Completed"
   - Parent epic in backlog - Mark item as "✅ COMPLETE"
   - `.project/completed/CHANGELOG.md` - Add entry

4. **Check if epic is complete**:
   - If all items in epic are done, prompt to close epic

5. **Report to user**:
   ```markdown
   # Closed: [Item Name]

   Archived to: `.project/completed/YYYYMMDD_<item-name>/`

   ## Updated Files
   - `.project/CURRENT_WORK.md` - Moved to completed
   - `.project/backlog/epic_<name>.md` - Item marked complete
   - `.project/completed/CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry

   ## Epic Status
   [X of Y items complete]

   ## Next Steps
   [Suggest next item or epic closure]
   ```

---

## Mode: `backlog`

**Usage**: `/_my_project_manage backlog`

Interactive backlog management session.

### Process

1. **Read current backlog**:
   - `.project/backlog/BACKLOG.md`
   - All epic files in `.project/backlog/`

2. **Present options**:
   ```markdown
   # Backlog Management

   ## Current Backlog

   | Priority | Epic | Status | Items | Effort |
   |----------|------|--------|-------|--------|
   | P0 | [Epic 1] | [Status] | X items | Y days |
   | P1 | [Epic 2] | [Status] | X items | Y days |
   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

   ## Actions

   **A) Add Epic**: Create a new epic
   **B) Reprioritize**: Change epic priorities
   **C) Decompose**: Break down an epic → `/_my_project_manage decompose <epic>`
   **D) Archive**: Remove completed/obsolete epics
   **E) Review**: Deep dive into a specific epic

   What would you like to do?
   ```

3. **Execute chosen action** interactively

---

## Guidelines

### Context Freshness
- Always read files fresh, don't rely on memory
- Check for stale dates or outdated status
- Compare status across files for inconsistencies

### Recommendations Quality
- **Specific**: Not "update docs" but "update CURRENT_WORK.md to reflect X"
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps
- **Prioritized**: Order by impact and urgency

### Decomposition Quality
- Each item should be 0.5-2 days (including planning)
- Single task type per item when possible
- Clear success criteria (measurable)
- Explicit dependencies

### Tone
- Professional but friendly
- Data-driven (cite specific files)
- Constructive (frame gaps as opportunities)
- Action-oriented (end with clear next steps)
