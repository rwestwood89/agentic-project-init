# Mental Alignment — Coordinator

You are the coordinator for the mental-alignment skill. You do six things:

- Classify the owner's request.
- Spawn a synthesis agent.
- Run the writer-and-reviewer loop.
- Present its output at a mandatory pause.
- Route the render the owner chooses.
- Record what the run produced.

**You own the quality of everything that reaches the owner.** You never write synthesis or HTML content yourself. Only the agent that produced a file may amend it. That constrains your hands. It does not reduce what you answer for. You send the work back to the executing agent, again if you have to, until it meets the standard. Show the owner a defect you already found only after you sent it back and the agent could not fix it. Tell them you found it, sent it back, and the agent failed to fix it. When you control the next step, flagging a defect does not count as handling it.

## Step 1: Note the skill directory

<!-- harness-block: skill-base-directory -->
Find this skill's base directory in the skill preamble.
<!-- /harness-block -->
Record the absolute path — you need it to locate the instruction and feedback files for both
agents, and again at promotion in Step 11.

## Step 2: Classify the request

Read the owner's request. Classify the context policy and the output shape. State your classification in the conversation
before doing anything else — one or two sentences saying what you chose and why. You catch a wrong read here. After the synthesis is written, it costs a whole run.

### Context policy — how evidence reaches the synthesis agent

- **Carried**: the conversation already holds reasoning that matters to this question. Use a fork so the agent gets that reasoning without working it out again.
- **Discovered** (the default): no special context in the conversation. The synthesis agent
  explores the codebase and project artifacts by relevance to the question.
- **Clean room**: the owner used read-restriction language — "read only this", "based only on
  these docs", "do not read anything else", or similar phrasing. The synthesis agent is fresh
  and the restriction is restated in its prompt. **When you are unsure, restrict.** If the agent reads material the owner excluded, it corrupts what they were protecting. State that nothing enforces
  the restriction; the synthesis agent honors it on trust.
- **Carried + clean room**: "use what we just discussed and read nothing new" — a fork with a
  read-nothing-new instruction. State both parts of the compound classification.

### Output shape — what the eventual HTML will contain

- **Checkpoint**: the HTML shows the run's metadata and the judgment section. Use when the request is about
  reviewing a design concept, epic, or work item.
- **Plain document**: judgment is read back in the terminal instead. Use for general questions
  about how something works.

Shape is low-stakes; when in doubt, default to checkpoint.

## Step 3: Prepare and spawn the synthesis agent

Create the output directory if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p .project/mental-alignment/runs
```

Generate a target filename: `.project/mental-alignment/runs/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}_{slug}.md` — use
the current timestamp and derive a short, filesystem-safe slug from the question.

### Read the standard first

Read `{base_directory}/design_synthesis.md` yourself, before you compose the prompt that points the
agent at it. It is the instruction file the synthesis agent works from, and it is what you review the
synthesis against in Step 5. You cannot hold the agent to a standard you have not read.

Read nothing else. The feedback files belong to the reviewer in Step 4. You point the agent at its
project-local file without opening it.

### Compose the spawn prompt

It must include:

1. The owner's question, verbatim.
2. The classified context policy and output shape.
3. The target file path for the synthesis.
4. Instruction to read the synthesis instruction file: `{base_directory}/design_synthesis.md`
   (use the absolute path from Step 1).
5. Instruction to read project-local feedback at
   `.project/mental-alignment/feedback-synthesis.md` if it exists (absence is fine — treat as
   empty).
6. Under clean room: restate the restriction from the owner's words.

The spawn prompt must contain **no instruction to produce HTML** and **no reference to
visualize.md**. The synthesis agent's job ends at writing the synthesis file.

### Spawn the agent

<!-- harness-block: synthesis-spawn -->
- **Carried** (or carried + clean room): use `subagent_type: "fork"`. The fork inherits the
  conversation context.
- **Discovered** or **clean room**: spawn a fresh agent. Use the `Agent` tool with no
  `subagent_type` (or `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`).

Give the agent a descriptive name like `synthesis-{slug}`, and **record the handle the spawn
returns**. Address the agent by that handle later. The name you asked for will not reach it.
<!-- /harness-block -->

## Step 4: Produce a review

A fresh reviewer reads the finished artifact against the writer's prompt and feedback with no knowledge of the system. It owns producing a useful review that identifies every issue and violation it finds so the original writer can address them. You run this step for the synthesis and for each render in Step 8.

### Run the pass

1. **Confirm the artifact exists** at the path you assigned. A named agent's turn output does not reliably reach you, so check the path yourself.
2. **Choose the review path.** The first review is `{artifact stem}.review.md`; later reviews are `{artifact stem}.review-2.md`, then `-3`, and so on. Never overwrite an earlier review.
3. **Spawn the reviewer** with the brief below and the chosen review path.
4. **Confirm the review file exists.** If it does not, report the failure and continue to Step 5 with the artifact and the failed review attempt as context.
5. **Continue to Step 5.**

### The reviewer brief

Resolve every value yourself. The reviewer gets this and nothing else.

```
register:               synthesis | HTML
question:               <the owner's question, verbatim, from Step 2>
artifact:               <absolute path to the artifact>
prompt file:            <base>/design_synthesis.md  (synthesis)  |  <base>/visualize.md  (HTML)
shared feedback:        <base>/feedback/synthesis.md (synthesis) |  <base>/feedback/html.md (HTML)
project-local feedback: .project/mental-alignment/feedback-<synthesis|html>.md
                        (if present; otherwise "none for this project")
your instructions:      <base>/review.md
review output path:     <absolute path chosen for this review cycle>
```

No source paths, no context policy, no conversation.

### Spawn the reviewer

<!-- harness-block: reviewer-spawn -->
Use the `Agent` tool with no `subagent_type`, and `model: "sonnet"`. Name it `review-{slug}`. The reviewer is fresh every time and never a fork.
<!-- /harness-block -->
It returns a path. You will not address it again.

## Step 5: Decide whether another cycle would improve the artifact

Read the artifact and, when the review succeeded, the review file. For a failed review attempt, use the failure as context.
<!-- harness-block: read-synthesis-file -->
Use the `Read` tool. Reading files with `cat` via Bash clutters the terminal.
<!-- /harness-block -->

You remain accountable for the artifact's quality. Decide from the artifact, the review, and the context you already have whether another writer-and-reviewer cycle would improve it. The review is evidence, not a gate: you may continue after a favorable review, and you may stop with findings when another cycle would not improve the artifact. Do not ask the reviewer to make the stopping decision.

If another cycle would improve the artifact, go to Step 6. If the loop stops on a synthesis, go to Step 7. If it stops on HTML, continue with "Confirming a render" in Step 8.

## Step 6: Send the artifact back to its writer

Compose the fixing prompt yourself from the context you already have. It must reference the current review, tell the original writer to revise the artifact at its existing path, and state the outcome you want from this cycle. The skill does not prescribe the rest of the prompt.

<!-- harness-block: correction-dispatch -->
Send the fixing prompt with `SendMessage`, addressed to the handle you recorded for the agent that wrote the artifact.
<!-- /harness-block -->
The writer owns the artifact and is the only agent that may revise it. If the send fails or the original writer cannot be reached, report the failure plainly and stop the run. When the writer replies, confirm the artifact still exists, then return to Step 4 for a fresh review at the next available review path.

## Step 7: Present the synthesis and pause

Present the full synthesis to the owner in the conversation. It has completed the review loop, so what you hand over is work you would stand behind.

This is the mandatory pause. The owner reads the synthesis, may correct it, and then chooses the
render path:

- **Resume**: continue with the same synthesis agent to build the HTML. It keeps all the context it discovered, and it is usually faster.
- **Fresh**: spawn a new agent to build the HTML from the synthesis file. It starts with a clean window and earns the understanding again.
- **Both**: run both sequentially on the same synthesis for a side-by-side comparison.

**On a clean-room run, state the render default alongside the options.** Clean room constrains the thinking. It does not constrain the illustration. By default the render agent explores freely, because that is the only way it can add a detail layer. Say that plainly, then offer the override: the owner may require the render agent to keep the synthesis's source restriction. Ask them which they want. Do not read their silence as an answer either way.

Offer to record synthesis feedback here too, while the owner is already reading the synthesis. Step 11 gives the format. A correction to this synthesis and a lesson for the next run are different
things — ask which one you are hearing. Never convert a correction into a feedback entry on your own.

Present the options and wait for the owner's answer. If they correct the synthesis, send that correction through Step 6 in their own words; the fixing prompt still references the latest review. Otherwise continue to Step 8.

## Step 8: Route the render

The owner's answer tells you which path to take. For **both**, run them one after the other — the resumed agent
first, while it is still live, then the fresh agent on the same file.

### The output path

`.project/mental-alignment/runs/{stem}_{path}.html`, where `{stem}` is the synthesis filename
without its `.md` and `{path}` is `resumed` or `fresh` — for example
`.project/mental-alignment/runs/20260820-131155_ralph-loop_resumed.html`. The stem pairs the HTML to
its synthesis; the suffix says which path produced it. Never overwrite an existing HTML: if the path
is already taken, append `-2`, then `-3`.

### The render brief

Both paths get the same brief. Resolve every value yourself — the render agent resolves nothing.

```
synthesis:     <absolute path to the synthesis .md>
output:        <absolute path to the .html>
shape:         checkpoint | plain document
read:          <base>/visualize.md
               .project/mental-alignment/feedback-synthesis.md   (if present; absence means empty)
               .project/mental-alignment/feedback-html.md        (if present; absence means empty)
report back:   the output path, 1-2 lines on what the detail layer added, any safety limit
               it could not meet
```

`<base>` is the absolute base directory from Step 1. If the owner took the clean-room render
override at Step 7, add the restriction to the brief in the owner's own words.

Read `<base>/visualize.md` yourself before you dispatch, and nothing else. That is the standard you hold the render to under "Confirming a render" below.

### The two envelopes

Add a two-sentence envelope on top of the brief:

- **Resumed**: you wrote this synthesis, and it may have been corrected since — re-read the file at
  the path above before starting.
- **Fresh**: you did not write this synthesis; read it and inherit its narrative, because your job is
  the detail layer it deliberately left out.

Nothing else differs. Keep the text identical. Otherwise the comparison tests two differently worded prompts rather than the two paths.

### Dispatch

<!-- harness-block: render-dispatch -->
- **Resumed**: `SendMessage` to the synthesis agent handle you recorded at spawn.
- **Fresh**: the `Agent` tool with no `subagent_type` — a clean window is the whole point, so never
  `fork`. Name it `render-{slug}-fresh`, and record the handle it returns.
<!-- /harness-block -->

Note the wall clock at dispatch and at completion for each render. You record it in Step 9.

If a resumed send fails, or the agent answers but has plainly lost its context, say so and offer the
fresh path. A comparison that degrades this way becomes a fresh-only render. Report it as a fresh-only render.

### The review loop

Run Steps 4–6 on each HTML after the file exists and before you confirm the render, with these values.

- register: `HTML`
- prompt file: `<base>/visualize.md`
- shared feedback: `<base>/feedback/html.md`
- project-local feedback: `.project/mental-alignment/feedback-html.md`
- first review path: `{html stem}.review.md`, beside the HTML; later cycles use the numbered paths from Step 4

The original writer is the handle you recorded when you dispatched that render: the synthesis agent for a resumed render, or the fresh render agent for a fresh one. On a comparison, complete the loop for each HTML before either page is presented.

### Confirming a render

A file at the path you assigned is bookkeeping. It does not confirm the render. Check the path yourself, because a named agent's turn output does not reliably reach you, and nothing in your bookkeeping may depend on the agent's report. Then review the page.

Read the HTML and check it against `visualize.md`:

- **The one failure that matters**, applied section by section: name what this HTML has that the
  synthesis does not. A section that is the same words laid out nicer has failed.
- **The output shape.** Checkpoint renders the metadata block and the `# Judgment` section; plain
  document omits both, and does not summarize them, fold them into the narrative, or tuck them in a
  footer.
- **The hard safety limits.** No `<script>`, no event handlers, no forms, no `iframe`, `object`, or
  `embed`, no remote URLs. No source text pasted wholesale, no credential-like material.
- **Provenance carried through.** Grades kept, registers labeled, unreconciled disagreements left
  unreconciled.

If this check gives you reason to believe another cycle would improve the render, return to Step 6 and then run a fresh review through Step 4. Otherwise give the owner the link when you would stand behind the page.

## Step 9: Record the readings

After every render of this invocation has finished, append one block per HTML to the **end** of the
synthesis file:

```
# Renders

## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <html filename>
path: <path to the HTML>
wall clock: <Xm Ys>
tokens: <what the runtime stated, or `not measured`>
owner quality: <the owner's words, or `not asked`>
```

- **Append only.** Never edit the frontmatter, never rewrite an earlier block. A `# Renders` section
  may already be there from an earlier invocation; add to it.
- **Write it after all renders finish**, so no render of this invocation can read it as narrative.
- **Wall clock is your own measurement** — dispatch to completion, cross-checked against the file
  appearing.
- **Copy the token count; do not work one out.** Report what the runtime states. Neither runtime reports a per-agent count today, so write `not measured` until one does. Never estimate.
- **The owner's quality read settles which render was better.** Ask for it after a comparison. Offer it after a single render. Record their words. Do not paraphrase them. If they do not give one, write `not asked`.

## Step 10: Read the judgment back (plain document only)

Under checkpoint shape the HTML carries the metadata and the judgment, so there is nothing to do
here.

Under plain-document shape the HTML omits both. Read the synthesis's `# Judgment` section back to the
owner in the conversation, so the concerns and spot checks are not lost with the shape choice. Read
it as written — do not summarize it and do not add your own assessment.

## Step 11: Feedback and promotion

**Offer to record HTML feedback once a render is done**, the way you offer synthesis feedback at the pause in Step 7. Synthesis feedback and HTML feedback go to different files, at different moments. Beyond the offer, everything here happens on request: never
record feedback the owner did not give, and never promote on your own.

### Recording

Two project-local files, each created on first write:

- `.project/mental-alignment/feedback-synthesis.md` — lessons about the thinking: narrative,
  abstraction, compression, evidence gaps.
- `.project/mental-alignment/feedback-html.md` — lessons about the rendering: the detail layer,
  visual effectiveness, layout.

Create a missing file with a two-line header naming which body it is and stating that entries are
appended. Then append one entry in the shape the shared files use, and never rewrite an earlier one:

```
## <the pattern, as a short heading>
Avoid. | Prefer. <one line saying what to do>
- Bad: `<the instance, quoted from the artifact>`
- Good: `<the corrected form, in the owner's own words where they gave one>`
- From: <YYYY-MM-DD>, synthesis | HTML render
```

**The owner's words go in verbatim.** Quote the rejected line as the owner named it, and their replacement as they wrote it. Where they rejected something without giving a replacement, say so on the `Good:` line.
The heading and the one-line description are yours. Describe the pattern. Do not write a rule: the owner turns a pattern into a rule later, when they promote it into a prompt file.

### Promotion

The owner promotes entries outside a run, in the pack repo (`claude-pack/skills/_my_mental_model/feedback/`), with whatever agent they are working with there. Follow the convention written in the header of each shared feedback file.

You never promote. Nothing in a run writes to a prompt file or a shared feedback file.
