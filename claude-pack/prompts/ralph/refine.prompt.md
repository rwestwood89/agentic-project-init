Below is an initial design document (V1) and a critical review of that design.
Produce a REFINED DESIGN (V2) that addresses the review findings.

Instructions:
1. Read the review carefully — especially Critical and Major issues
2. Address each issue explicitly in the refined design
3. Keep what works — don't rewrite sections that passed review
4. For each significant change, add a brief note explaining the change

At the end of the refined design, include a section:

## Changes from V1

- [Change 1]: [Why — which review issue it addresses]
- [Change 2]: [Why]
- ...

YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE IS THE OUTPUT FILE. Start directly with the markdown
content (e.g., "# Design Document ..."). Do not summarize, describe, or
comment on the document — just produce it. No preamble, no explanation.
