I have a project concept focused on OUTCOMES. I need you to create a
detailed DESIGN DOCUMENT that specifies the architecture and implementation
approach. This design will be used to generate specifications for an
automated coding agent (Ralph Wiggum loop).

Create a design document that includes:

## 1. Overview
- One paragraph summary of what this system does
- Primary use cases (3-5 bullet points)

## 2. Data Model
- Core entities and their relationships
- Schema definitions (use TypeScript interfaces or JSON Schema style)
- Storage format decisions (files, database, etc.)

## 3. Architecture
- Component breakdown (what are the major pieces?)
- How components interact (data flow)
- Key interfaces between components

## 4. Core Algorithms
- Any non-trivial logic that needs careful implementation
- Edge cases that must be handled
- Performance considerations

## 5. External Interfaces
- CLI commands (if applicable)
- API endpoints or MCP tools (if applicable)
- File formats for input/output

## 6. Constraints & Invariants
- Rules that must NEVER be violated
- Security considerations
- Determinism requirements

## 7. Phasing (optional)
- If this is a multi-phase project, what's in Phase 1 vs later?
- What can be deferred?

Keep the design:
- Concrete enough that a coding agent can implement it
- Abstract enough that implementation details are left to the agent
- Focused on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line HOW

YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE IS THE OUTPUT FILE. Start directly with the markdown
content (e.g., "# Design Document ..."). Do not summarize, describe, or
comment on the document — just produce it. No preamble, no explanation.
